# Slim 4 Template Project

**This is still on progress**

As the default skeleton Slim 4 is too complicated for me and there are things that I dislike, I made my own version of template. This is way easier, at least for me. I put it as public repository in order for me to use it again on the next project. If somehow someone feel it is useful, then it is a bonus.

## The very first

You will need to clone this repository, by typing this command below:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/didats/Slim4-Template your-directory-name
```

Once you are done, rename the setting file and edit them. The setting file able to hold as many variables as you want.

```
$ mv .settings.default .settings
```

Then the last one, 

```
$ composer install
```
