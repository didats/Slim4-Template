# Slim 4 Template Project

**This is still on progress**

The default skeleton from official page of Slim4 is quite difficult for me to understand, and not fun. This version is based on my understanding, and in my opinion quite easy. 

I am putting it to the public repository so I could use it in the future. I hope it could be also useful for the others.

## The very first

You will need to clone this repository, by typing:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/didats/Slim4-Template your-directory-name
```

Once you are done, rename the setting file and edit them. The setting file able to hold as many variables as you want.

```
$ mv .settings.default .settings
```

Then the last one, 

```
$ composer install
```
